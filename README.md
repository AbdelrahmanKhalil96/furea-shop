2. **Test**
   - Uses Microsoft Playwright Docker image.
   - Runs end-to-end (E2E) Playwright tests.
   - Generates HTML test reports in Jenkins.
   - ‚ùå If tests fail, the pipeline stops (no deployment).

3. **Deploy**
   - Uses Netlify CLI inside Docker.
   - Deploys `dist/furea-shop` to Netlify production.
   - Requires Jenkins credentials for `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`.
